Create a componet named: 'playlist'.

The component will get Array<Item>.

interface Item {
  id: string,
  label: string
}

The template should show the list of items, inside of each item there will be a button 'pinned' that can be pressed.
When that button is clicked, the item is pinned to that position in the list and can not be moved.

The component will also have a button with text: 'Shuffle'. When clicked it will shuffle ( random ) the list expect of the pinned items.

Bouns : Implement a drag & drop for an item, that you can manually move an item from a position A to poistion B.
If that item is pinned it can't be drag/moved.
